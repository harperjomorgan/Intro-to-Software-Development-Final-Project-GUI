# Intro-to-Software-Development-Final-Project-GUI
This is a Python Quiz Game GUI I developed for my Introduction to Programming Languages class in Fall of 2023.

The application will open and you will see a number of questions available to answer. The content of each question pertains to some tidbit of Python knowledge. Once you've opened the quiz, you can select an answer and hit "next" and the quiz game will save your response and move on to the next question. At any point during taking the quiz, you can press "Quit" to exit the application. Once you've completed each of the questions and provided a response, a window will pop up with your score--good luck!~
